# SecurityModule.sh
# Security Module for Exclusive Script Execution

This Bash script serves as a security module designed to prevent concurrent execution of critical scripts. It includes functions to create a lock directory, verify permissions, and manage a lock file to ensure exclusive execution.

## Features

- **Exclusive Script Execution:** Prevents multiple instances of a script from running simultaneously, ensuring data consistency and avoiding conflicts.
- **Password Verification:** Validates a user-entered password against a remotely stored encrypted password.
- **Logging:** Logs important events, such as script initiation, successful executions, and attempts at concurrent execution, to a log file.

## Usage

1. **Inclusion in Script:**
   - Import the security module into your script using `source SecurityModule.sh` to enable exclusive execution.

2. **Customization:**
   - Customize the `main_script_logic` function to perform additional security checks or specific script operations.

3. **Secure Operation:**
   - Execute your critical scripts with confidence, knowing that the security module ensures exclusive execution.

## Example Use Case

Consider a scenario where a critical database operation script (`script_critical_operation.sh`) must run exclusively to prevent data conflicts. By incorporating this security module, only one instance of the script can execute at a time, enhancing data integrity.
